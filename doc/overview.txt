./script/log will have logs you download using fetch_log.rb

create_test_data.rb - creates a few demo accounts, timezones, etc.

drop_db.sh - drops the database

recycle_env - recyles the environment (database, data) to give you a fresh start

logreader.rb - runs continuously, reading Apache's access.log

fetch_mysql.rb - dumps the db from the production server and downloads it to ./script/db
fetch_log.rb - fetches n lines from the apache log on the server into ./script/log

change_db_type.rb - changes the table type of a database table

migrate.sh - migrate up and down. Saves a few characters.
