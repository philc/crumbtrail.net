Apache apparently resolves the client's hostname in its logs; how can that hurt or help our performance?
"- All the usual stuff: don’t follow symlinks, don’t use .htaccess files, don’t resolve client hostnames (move the logs to another machine and batch it later), etc.."


verify that index and pagedata own the id they're modifying

search the db of referers for urls "like yahoo" to find out which searches we're missing

collapse referers for the current db takes _minutes_


I think recent_unique_referers isn't prefetching each referer's data


a nice UI for the search panel would be to show a little search engine logo image, a little square, in the table rows

wouldn't take up much space and you could quickly see which engine gave you a hit without mousing over the link
