implement password reset (a beta user has already needed it =/)
implement compressed javascript into the build process.
progress meter when you click next
Nicer error messages for no route, etc.
preload the circle image

analyitics -
see how often each member logs in, which projects he views, how many times he reloads the page


verify that index and pagedata own the id they're modifying

search the db of referers for urls "like yahoo" to find out which searches we're missing. DO we capture images.google.com? check eightpence

collapse referers for the current db takes _minutes_


I think recent_unique_referers isn't prefetching each referer's data


a nice UI for the search panel would be to show a little search engine logo image, a little square, in the table rows
wouldn't take up much space and you could quickly see which engine gave you a hit without mousing over the link




parsing bugs:
yahoo regex's
this search:
http://google.com/search?q=definition:+vulpes&hl=en&start=10&sa=N
gets a query term assigned as "definition" instead of "definition: vulpes"
images.google.com is not a referer..

some of the search referers don't have http:// in front of them

Performance notes:
speed of inserts:
http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/insert-speed.html

Apache apparently resolves the client's hostname in its logs; how can that hurt or help our performance?
"- All the usual stuff: don’t follow symlinks, don’t use .htaccess files, don’t resolve client hostnames (move the logs to another machine and batch it later), etc.."
